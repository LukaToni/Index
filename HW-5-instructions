Write a program that, on the basis of the input text displayed index. Funded
index is a sorted list of all the different words that appear in the text.
For each word of the text in the index referred ascending ordered list
line numbers in which that word appears.
The first line of input are given positive integers a and b, separated by a space, then
followed by an input text that satisfies the following conditions:

  • text contains only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, spaces, and characters
    new line (\ n);
  • consecutive words in the same row are always separated by exactly one space;
  • Each row (the last one) ends with \ n;
  • at the beginning and end of the line no spaces;
  • no word is longer than a character;
  • total number of words throughout the text is not greater than b;
  • Each row contains at least one letter (up while there is no limit);
  • text contains at least one line (up while there is no limit).
  
At the output of your program should print an index, in a form which is evident from the
the following examples:
Input:

15 100
ljudska
marko skace
marko skace marko skace
po zeleni trati
aj aj ajajaj
po zeleni trati

Output:

aj 5 5
ajajaj 5
ljudska 1
marko 2 3 3
po 4 6
skace 2 3 3
trati 4 6
zeleni 4 6

The symbol \n finish the last line of output. At the end of each row does not print spaces!
